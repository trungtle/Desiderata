It was so dark in there, with the trees so tall and the sun and moon far away, their lights trapped above the branches. Creatures of black forest crept uneasily... 'The predators are on the hunt', you remembered the lion beast said..."

The beast never mentioned a word but guided in silence, choosing his footsteps carefully and many times revealed secret paths that was well hidden. Without a doubt, you trusted him to take you to the right place. You tried to make  conversation, but your presence were ignored..."
